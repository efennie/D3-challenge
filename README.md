# D3-challenge

This challenge is meant to emulate an article for a local paper on health data using The U.S. Census Data to create a data visualization of health risk factors.

The data is from a 2014 American Community Survey 1-year estimate from a study conducted by the U.S. Census. It includes different health risk factors such as obesity, smoking, poverty, and lack of healthcare to get a better idea of the health challenges Americans face.

Within the folders there are two css files for formatting the visualization, an index.html page for use on a local server to display the visualization, an app.js file which holds the code for creating the chart, and the data itself (data.csv). The app.js file will create a visualization of percentage of people without adequate acess to healthcare versus the percentage of people in poverty. This code can be easily modified to explore other health risk factors included in the data set.
